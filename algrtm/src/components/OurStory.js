        Our goal has always been to drive <strong>positive change</strong> and
        make a meaningful impact. We thrive on seeking out challenging
        endeavors. For us, it's about believing in the power of algorithms, not
        just AI. We focus on areas of machine learning from the point of view of
        extending intelligence, rather than replacing it.
